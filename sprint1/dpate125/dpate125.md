# Sprint 1

Name: Deep Patel

GitHubID: Deep0320

Group Name: Rocky Top Transit Link

### What I planned to do

* Issue #4: Create a favorites list page [Link to Issue 4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/4)
* Issue #5: Turn the favorites list into a slide-in [Link to Issue 5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/5)
* Issue #6: Create a history slide in [Link to Issue 6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/6)

### What I did not do
* Everything I was assigned for sprint 1 was completed.

### What Problems I encountered
* One problem I encountered was that the slide-in functionality for both the history list and the favorites list would cause one of them to stop working but I fixed it later on.
* I did want to integrate my files with the other files Anant was working on, but we weren't able to finish that this sprint.

### Issues I worked on

[#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/4) Create Favorites List Page

[#6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/6) Create a history list

### Files I worked on

* sprint1/dpate125/index.html
* sprint1/dpate125/script.js
* sprint1/dpate125/style.css

### What I accomplished

* **Favorites List**: The favorites list page is able to add locations that a user thinks they will need frequently. It has the basic functionality needed for such a featuere like this such as adding, removing, and saving the list for when they refresh the page.

* **Favorites List Slide-in**: The favorites list was converted into a slide-in instead of a separate page so that it does not hinder the flow of the webpage and give the user quick access to that feature without having to go to a different page.

* **History List**: This feature stores a user's recently used bus stops. It will be useful for the user to know where they have been recently.
