**GitHub ID**: anantsahoo

**Group Name**: Rocky Top Transit Link

## What I Planned to Do

- Design and implement a login section skeleton (Issue #2) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/2]
- Implement a navigation bar with placeholder links (Issue #3) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/3]

## What I Did not Do

- Everything was accomplished for this sprint.

## What Problems I Encountered

- **Page not fitting properly**: Initially I had troubles on fitting the page properly according to the contents added.
- **Problem integrating other group member's frontend work**: Although not required for this sprint 1, I wanted to integrate other group member's work into one folder and multiple components, but had issues with that and could not complete for sprint 1.

## What I Accomplished

- **Web Page Structure**: Created the basic layout with HTML, defining key sections like the header, main content area, and footer. This provides a foundation for future development (Issue #1).
- **Login Section Skeleton**: Implemented a basic form with fields for the username/email and password without functional backend logic. This form is styled minimally for placeholder purposes (Issue #2).
- **Navigation Bar**: Developed a styled navigation bar with placeholder links. It is responsive and ready for the addition of actual navigation links (Issue #3).
