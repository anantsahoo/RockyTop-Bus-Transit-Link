## Files I Worked On:
* sprint1/wdougla4/run.py
* sprint1/wdougla4/requirements.txt
* sprint1/wdougla4/api-response.py
* sprint1/wdougla4/templates/index.html

## What I Did Not Do:
I got everything done

## Problems Encountered:
* Most of the problems I had dealt with getting the Google Maps API to start in the first place. However, that hurdle was fairly small since Google Cloud makes managing and activating APIs fairly simple. 
* The other problem I had was getting the map to display and creating a way to show off what I built instead of running a script with some command line arguments for addresses. This shouldn't be a problem in the future, since that frontend stuff is something that I wouldn't be responsible for, but it was certainly an obstacle for this sprint specifically.
