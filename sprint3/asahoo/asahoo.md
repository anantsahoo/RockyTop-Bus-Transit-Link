## What Problems I Encountered

- **Problem Adapting to the Backend When Working on My Issues**: Initially, I had problems getting to complete my issues. Since I was in charge of working with soley frontend in previous sprints, working on both frontend and backend for sprint 3 was my inital challenge. I eventually figured out how to fix my problems and get my tasks done.

## What I Accomplished

- **Fix Login Button on the Home Page**: There was a bug on the home page that caused problems when a user wanted to sign in. I fixed it and made it user friendly. (Issue #37).
- **Enabled Home Rerouting**: I made sure that there was a way that a user can navigate from one page to another. To do this I ensured that the links in the nav bar enabled the user to navigate to the page of interest. (Issue #38).
- **Added Register Account and Settings**: I ensured that the user can register their account from anywhere in any page. Morevoer, I ensured that the user sees the settings option when they have signed in and registered. (Issue #39).
- **Added Basic Footers to Every Page**: After integrating the frontend with backend, there were multiple pages missing the footers. I ensured that at the very least, there were footers in every page. (Issue #40).
- **Aded Nav Bar Onto Different Pages**: After integrating the frontend with backend, there were multiple pages missing the nav bar. I ensured that the pages had the same nav bar. (Issue #44).
