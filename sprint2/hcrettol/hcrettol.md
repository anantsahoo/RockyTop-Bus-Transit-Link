## What I Did Not Do
- Everything planned was completed.

## Problems Encountered
- **Group Member Left**: One of our group members left the day before the end the sprint and he hadn't worked on any of his issues.
- **Route Calculation Bugs**: The route calculation doesn't fully work for every stop.
- **Integrating Other Group Member's Code**: We are still working on integrating front end team's html/css/js pages into backend. Right now backend has basically temporary html/css/js files.

- Fixed the issue where the autocomplete suggestions were hidden behind the map.
- Calculated and displayed travel and arrival times for bus trips.
- Implemented user information authentication to enhance security.
- Added a page to view detailed stop data, providing more information to users.
