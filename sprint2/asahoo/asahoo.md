# Sprint2

**Name**: Anant Jeet Sahoo

**GitHub ID**: anantsahoo

**Group Name**: Rocky Top Transit Link

## What I Planned to Do

- Merge the Frontend Webpages from Sprint 1 (Issue #20) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/20]
- Get and Send Login Information to the Backend (Issue #21) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/21]
- Update the Layout of the Webpage (Issue #23) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/23]
- Add a Way to View Travel/Arrival Time (Issue #28) [https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/RockyTop-Transit-Link/issues/28]

## What I Did not Do

- Most of the tasks for Sprint 2 were accomplished, except for the acceptance of the login request sent from the frontend, which was not completed by another team member from the backend.

## What Problems I Encountered

- **Problem integrating other group member's frontend work**: When I was integrating other group member's frontend component into the primary webpage, I initally had issues of the pages not being in the right layout. I essentially figured this out and got it solved.
- **A Teammate Dropping the Course**: The plan for the teammate was to integrate any features from the frontend to the backend and handle process request sent from the frontend. Due to the person dropping the course, we had conflicts integrating this aspect properly as we intended for sprint 2.

## What I Accomplished

- **Integrated FrontEnd Webpage**: Integrated frontend features and different versions of webpages into a singular webpage. Made sure there were not any merge conflicts resulting from this task. (Issue #20).
- **Sent Login Information to the Backend**: Sent the login credentials from the user to the backend. Ensured that the proper login credentials were being sent to the backend. (Issue #21).
- **Update Layout of the Page**: Updated the styling, logic, funtionality, and basic look of the webpage. Furthermore, ensured that the theme of our website was enhanced. (Issue #23).
- **Add a Way to View Travel/Arrival Time**: Provided a feature for users to view estimated travel and arrival times directly from the map in the backend. Now, when users enter the source and destination in the backend, they can view the estimated time for the bus to travel or arrive. (Issue #28).
