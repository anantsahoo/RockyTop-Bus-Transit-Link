## What I Accomplished

- **Add Time**: I added an option for users to input the time they wish to depart so that they can create a better transportation plan. If the user doesn't enter a time, it will default to the current time. (Issue #72).
- **Add Calculation of Non-Bus Stop Start Entries**: I made a calculation the closest bus stop to the start if the user types in a starting point that is not a bus stop. If the starting point is invalid, it returns an error message. (Issue #73).
- **Add Calculation of Non-Bus Stop End Entries**: I made a calculation the closest bus stop to the start if the user types in a ending point that is not a bus stop. If the ending point is invalid, it returns an error message. (Issue #74).
