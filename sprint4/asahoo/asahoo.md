## What I Accomplished

- **Fixed Map Page Styling**: The map page style did not match the general theme of the webpage and it was not pretty. Therefore, I was taked to complete this issue to ensure that the map page looks asthetically pleasing and matches with our chosen theme. (Issue #63).
- **Created Proper Button for Logout**: I made sure that the logout button did not get camouflaged within the hero section. (Issue #64).
- **Ensured Proper Footer Place in Website**: I ensured that the footer was showing up properly and was in its own section in each and every page. (Issue #65).
- **Fixed Map Legend Glitch**: When I zoomed out of the map, the legend glitched out and there were duplicates of legend. I ensured that these did not happen. (Issue #66).
