# Favorites List
## How to run the program
This program is designed to create a favorites list for saving a set of items. To run it, ensure you have the vs code extension live server or a similar extension in vs code / other editor that can launch an html file in your browser. Then just right click the html file on the left and launch with the live server in your browser. 

## How to use the Program
To use the program, simply type in whatever you want added to the list in the bar, and click the add button. It will show up on the list and if you want to remove an item click the x button next to the item on the list. It also saves your list items so if you refresh the browser, it should be able to save your list items.

## How it relates to the Project
In our bus transit system, we plan to have a list of favorite in which the user will be able to add bus stops to so that it makes it easy to get to the most frequently used bus stops. This program will need to be updated later as we add more functionality to the list such as storing the bus stop information and not just the name.
