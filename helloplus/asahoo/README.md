# HelloPlus Assignment

## Description

This program runs welcome page and states the time of the day. It greets the user based on the user's current time. The user can input their name and then the screen will update based on their name. Also the webpage has general information about the author.

## Installation

Ensure you have VS code IDE or equivalent to use the program. Install node js to run JavaScript locally on machine (outside web-browser). Install necessary extensions for HTML and CSS, and ensure you have Live Server extension from Ritwick Dey to run the program on local host on VS Code (install equivalent extension if using other IDE).

## Relevance to Project

The time display and the input text as well as the button to enter the text field might be helpful in the project when we want for the user to log in into the website. After the user logs in into the website, we want the user to be greeted properly.
